      <li>2 garlic cloves, finely chopped</li>
      <li>275g/9¾oz risotto rice, such as Arborio</li>
      <li>100ml/3½fl oz dry vermouth or white wine (optional)</li>
      <li>1 litre/1¾ pint stock (made with 1 vegetable or chicken stock cube)</li>
      <li>2 good pinches dried flaked chilies (crushed chillies)</li>
      <li>1 small lemon, finely grated</li>
      <li>50g/1¾oz Parmesan or vegetarian hard cheese, finely grated, plus extra to serve</li>

    </ul>
    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Heat the oil in a large saucepan or medium flameproof casserole. Add the onion, carrots and celery, stir well then cover and cook over a low heat for 10–12 minutes, or until soft and lightly browned, stirring 2–3 times to prevent it sticking. Add the garlic and cook for 2 minutes more, stirring.</li>
      <li>Stir in the risotto rice and cook for a minute, stirring constantly. Pour in the vermouth (or wine, if using) and bring to a simmer. Cook for 30–40 seconds, stirring.</li>
      <li>Add all the stock and the chilli to the risotto. Bring to a gentle simmer and cook uncovered for 22–25 minutes, or until the rice is tender and very creamy. Stir the risotto every 4–5 minutes for the first 10 minutes of the cooking time, then more regularly as the liquid reduces and the rice swells; stirring constantly for the final 5 minutes.</li>
      <li>Stir in the lemon zest and hard cheese. Season to taste with salt and pepper and serve topped with extra Parmesan and freshly chopped parsley if you like.</li>
